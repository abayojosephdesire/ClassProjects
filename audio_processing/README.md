# Audio processing
In this project, we manipulated audio files to produce some neat effects. This repository contains not only a template file that we used for developing our project (lab.py) but also several audio files in the sounds directory, with names ending with .wav (you can try opening these files in an audio program to hear their contents).

Over the course of this project, we refreshed ourselves on some important features and structures within Python, and we also familiarized ourselves with interactions with files on disk (and create some really neat sound effects as well).

Enough comments were added in lab.py

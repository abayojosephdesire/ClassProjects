# Image processing 1
In this project, we built a few tools for manipulating digital images, akin to those found in image-manipulation toolkits like Photoshop and GIMP. Interestingly, many classic image filters are implemented using the same ideas we developed over the course of this project.

For this project, we focused on greyscale images only.

Enough comments were added in lab.py
